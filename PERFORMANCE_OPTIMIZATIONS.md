# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Major Changes Made to Improve Game Performance

### 1. Frame Rate Control
- Added FPS throttling to limit to 60fps maximum
- Capped deltaTime to prevent huge jumps that cause lag spikes
- Added frame interval checking to ensure consistent timing

### 2. Particle System Optimization
- **Reduced particle counts**: Trail particles reduced from 3:2 to 2:1, explosion particles reduced from 12 to 8
- **Shorter particle lifetimes**: Trail particles now last 200-300ms instead of 300-500ms
- **Aggressive particle limiting**: Added MAX_PARTICLES constant (150) with enforcement
- **Optimized particle updates**: Created `updateParticlesOptimized()` with inline calculations
- **Particle culling**: Automatically removes oldest particles when limit is exceeded
- **Simplified rendering**: Removed expensive shadow effects and complex shapes for particles

### 3. Game Loop Optimizations
- **Throttled trail generation**: Player trail particles only created every 50ms instead of every frame
- **Reduced validation frequency**: Object validation only runs every 500ms instead of every frame
- **Optimized collision detection**: Added particle count checks before creating explosion effects

### 4. Rendering Optimizations
- **Simplified particle rendering**: Removed expensive shadows, complex shapes, and multiple draw calls
- **Early exit conditions**: Skip rendering very small or nearly invisible particles
- **Batched operations**: Reduced individual canvas context calls

### 5. Memory Management
- **Better object reuse**: Particles are processed in-place where possible
- **Reduced object creation**: Fewer temporary objects created during updates
- **Efficient filtering**: Using for-loops instead of array methods for particle updates

### 6. Boss Animation Optimization
- **Reduced continuous particles**: Boss defeat animation creates fewer particles per frame
- **Limited explosion frequency**: Reduced from 30% to 20% chance per frame

## Expected Performance Improvements

- **Reduced lag spikes** from deltaTime capping and FPS limiting
- **Lower memory usage** from particle count limits and shorter lifetimes  
- **Smoother gameplay** from optimized update loops and rendering
- **Better frame rate consistency** especially during heavy particle effects

## Configuration

Key performance settings can be adjusted in `GAME_CONFIG`:
- `MAX_PARTICLES`: 150 (maximum particles allowed at once)
- Target FPS: 60 (with throttling)
- Trail spawn interval: 50ms
- Validation interval: 500ms

These optimizations should significantly improve the game's performance while maintaining visual quality.
